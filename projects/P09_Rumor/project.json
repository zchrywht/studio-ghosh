    "description": "Rumor is a concept store and café designed in collaboration between Studio Ghosh and Alicja Wozniak for fashion designer Tatiana Cueva, situated at the intersection of Sonora and Amsterdam in Mexico City. Located along a pedestrian street lined with greenery, the space occupies an Art Deco building whose street facade features a distinctive band of green terrazzo. The storefront is divided into two distinct experiences: on the left, a frameless glass entrance invites visitors into the jewel-like retail interior, while on the right, an open sidewalk café engages directly with the street.\nThe spatial strategy employs a single angled line that cuts across the plan from the center of the front facade to a truncated mirrored wall at the back, creating a forced perspective. This geometric division organizes the program clearly: café, dressing room, and bathroom occupy one side, with browsing space on the other.",
